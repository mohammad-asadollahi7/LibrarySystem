### LibrarySystem
#### This exercise implements a library system in two modes. In the first mode, reading and writing data (book and person information) is done through a static class, which has the major drawback of getting rid of new information after the program is finished. In the second mode, information is read and written by JSON files, which won't have the drawback of the first mode.
